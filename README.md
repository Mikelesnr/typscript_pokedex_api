# Overview

This project is designed to demonstrate the capabilities of the TypeScript language by creating a Pokedex API. The software fetches data for Pokémon from a local API and displays it in a structured format. The purpose of this project is to enhance my understanding of TypeScript, including its syntax, type safety, and integration with other libraries like Express and Axios.

The project includes two main components:

1. An Express server that provides an API to fetch Pokémon data by name.
2. A script that uses recursion to fetch data for multiple Pokémon and outputs the data to the terminal.

# Development Environment

The development environment for this project includes the following tools and libraries:

- **Visual Studio Code**: A powerful code editor with TypeScript support.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime used to run the server and scripts.
- **TypeScript**: A strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript.
- **Express**: A web application framework for Node.js.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
- **ts-node**: A TypeScript execution environment for Node.js.

# Future Work

There are several areas for future improvement and additional features:

- Add more routes to the API for fetching different types of Pokémon data.
- Implement error handling and logging for better debugging and monitoring.
- Create a front-end interface to interact with the API and display Pokémon data.
- Optimize the recursive function to handle larger datasets more efficiently.
